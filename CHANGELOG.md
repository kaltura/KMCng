### Known Issues
**Entries -> Search categories**: This feature is currently under development and will be released shortly.

**KMCng Login process**: The login process presents basic abilities needed to access the entries list. It lacks graphic design and addtional screens (register, forgot password etc.). It contains the following:
- A basic login form.
- Fetching minimal information about the user/partner required for the entries list.
- Log-out process (basic support only)

**Upper Menu Icons**: The upper menu icons are partially active. The Help menu opens a dropdown placeholder (not functional). The user icon opens a dropdown allowing logout. All other options in this menu are just placeholders.

**Localization**: The current version contains a localization mechanism. Currently, only English is available. Selecting other languages doesn't apply.

**Entries Permissions**: The permissions mechanism is currently under design and is not part of this release.

**Entry Drill-down**: Entry drill-down is not part of this drop. Clicking an entry name or selecting an action from the entry actions menu doesn't invoke drill-down.

**Bulk Operations**: Bulk operations are supported in the entries list screen. However, the actual operations cannot be invoked in this version.
