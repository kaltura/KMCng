### Known Issues
**Entries application > Refine popup:** The refine popup contains 4 calendar components.
When the user click on a calendar component, a visual calendar is shown which is also a popup. 

The component is part of [PrimeNG suite](primefaces.org/primeng/). We use version 1.0.1 which doesn't handle a nested popup correctly. At the moment, the calendar is exceed the boundary of the 'Refine popup' and is shown partially. 

We reported this bug in the [following issue](https://github.com/primefaces/primeng/issues/1833) and waiting for their response to better understand how to solve this issue.
